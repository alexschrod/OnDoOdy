# Duty tool list. When players enter duty mode, their inventory will be saved, and
# they will instead be given this list of items. Setting a slot to AIR or 0 or
# not specifying anything for a slot means they get no item in that slot.
# The items listed can be either material name
# (see http://jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Material.html for list) or
# material item ID number.

# This setting switches between exclude mode and include mode. Which mode you should
# choose depends on your style. When include mode is true, the lists below configure
# what is allowed. In other words, anything not explicitly allowed below is disallowed.
# On the other hand, when include mode is false, the opposite is true; anything not
# explicitly disallowed is allowed.
#
# The original DoOdy plug-in only had exclude mode. I lean towards (and wanted) the
# opposite behavior, so my default will be the opposite of DoOdy's only behavior. In
# other words, set this to 'false' to have OnDoOdy behave like DoOdy did.
