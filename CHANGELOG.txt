Version 1.2:
	+ Added events when for going on duty (which is Cancellable) and for when having gone on duty, so other plug-ins can react and interact with OnDoOdy.
	+ Added configuration setting for giving players additional permissions when going on duty.
	= Include usage instructions for /ondoody back when the player has the doody.back permission.
	! Improved error messages when going on or off duty fails and when saving/storing last duty location fails.
	! Using the /ondoody back command now requires the doody.back permission.
	! Using the /ondoody list command now requires the doody.list permission.
	! Only print usage instructions for /ondoody list when the player has the doody.list permission.

Version 1.1:
	+ Mobs now won't attack players who are on duty. Previously, when trying to punch pigmen for instance, they would start behaving like usual and start targeting the player.
	+ On-duty players cannot put out fires, unless the material 'FIRE' is in the list of blocks that it is allowed to break, or the player has block breaking permission.
	= Restore food level when going off duty. Previously, it was stored when going on duty, but not restored when going off duty.
	! Save and restore more player variables when going on and off duty: exhaustion, saturation, fall distance, fire ticks, remaining air, velocity.
